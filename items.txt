// Item database file
//	The line above **must** be the first line of the items file!!!
//	
//	Total validation is performed when reading this data. Nothing you do can cause the program to crash.  It may spit error messages and quit for lack of something decent to do but it will not crash or do unexpected things. It shouldn't anyway. If it does, please let us know.
//	
//	The first item has the name "template" and will be ignored.  You can use it as a 'template'.  Copy it to the bottom of the file and edit the copy to add your item to the database.
//	
//	Each line is of the form    name = value (value may be omitted)
//	eg:		Special Ability = 
//	This line will be interpreted as setting 'Special Ability' to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.
//	
//	White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.  So, for example:
//		attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//		attack bonus=3<cr>
//	are equivalent.  But
//		attack    bonus = 3
//		attack bonus = 3
//	are different.
//	
//	Lines starting with two slashes are comment lines.  Like this one.
//	
//	Attribute names are case-insensitive.  
//		Name = Wimpy Axe
//		namE = Wimpy Axe
//		NAME = Wimpy Axe
//	are equivalent.
//	Text values retain their case.  Values with enumerated possibilities are case-insensitive.  Example  baseclass = PaLaDiN     + FiGhTeR+ThIeF
//	
//	File names can use the UNIX syntax with slashes because the backslash is used to escape special characters and it gets ugly to put double backslashes everywhere.  If you like to use backslashes you may. We will accept either.  Even mixed in a single filename.
//	Example:    C:/UAF\\src\\guild of ravens/release1/beta\\art/barkeep.bmp
//	
//	Item definitions are delimited by \(BEGIN) ........ \(END) which must start in column 1.  This ain't free format. You get what you pay for.  
//	
//	 ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//	
//	Each item is defined by the following fields:
//	
//	Name (text, required - item record ignored if missing or blank).
//	
//	Each item mut have a unique name.  You may add a qualifier to a name (separated with a vertical bar) to make it unique.  For example:
//		Axe
//		Axe|Sharp
//		Axe|Dull
//	The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The qualifier is discarded when the binary files for the design are created.  But the unique name is necessary during the design stage to allow unambiguous references to the items.  During gameplay they are identified by a binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion between the three Axes even though they all print as 'Axe'.

//Scimitar of Speed: This is a magical weapon, usually of +2 bonus, that automatically grants its wielder the first attack in a melee round, even though some magical effect might have otherwise slowed his speed and reaction time. It also allows more than one strike in some rounds, increasing the wielder's figure for attacks per melee round by one place, so that if one attack is normal, then the improvement is to two attacks per round. This increase in attacks is cumulative with any other bonus attacks (such as those provided by a haste spell).
//The order of attacks in the round is determined normally after the wielder of the scimitar of speed has made his first attack to begin activity in the round. It is possible, for instance, that a wielder entitled to three attacks in the round will attack once before any other action takes place, and then (because of poor initiative rolls or other factors) take his remaining two attacks at the very end of the round.

Only a remove curse spell will enable the boots to be removed once their true nature is revealed.

//oots of Striding and Springing: The wearer of these magical boots has a base movement rate of 12, regardless of size or weight. This speed can be maintained tirelessly for up to 12 hours per day, but thereafter the boots no longer function for 12 hours—they need that long to "recharge."
//In addition to the striding ability, these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. While "normal'' paces for the individual wearing this type of footgear are three feet long, the boots also enable forward jumps of up to 30 feet, backward leaps of 9 feet, and vertical springs of 15 feet.
//If circumstances permit the use of such movement in combat, the wearer can effectively strike and spring away when he has the initiative during a melee round. However, such activity involves a degree of danger—there is a base 20% chance that the wearer of the boots will stumble and be stunned on the following round. Adjust the 20% chance downward by 3% for each point of Dexterity the wearer has above 12 (i.e., 17% at Dexterity, 14% at 14, 11% at 15, 8% at 16, 5% at 17, and only 2% at 18 Dexterity). In any event, the boots better Armor Class by 1 due to the quickness of movement they allow, so Armor Class 2 becomes 1, Armor Class 1 becomes 0, etc.

//Boots, Winged: These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. If magic is detected for, they radiate a faint aura of both enchantment and alteration. When they are on the possessor's feet and he or she concentrates on the desire to fly, the boots sprout wings at the heel and empower the wearer to fly, without having to maintain the concentration.
//The wearer can use the boots for up to two hours per day, all at once or in several shorter flights. If the wearer tries to use them for a longer duration, the power of the boots fades rapidly, but it doesn't abruptly disappear—the wearer slowly descends to the ground.
//For every twelve hours of uninterrupted non-use, the boots regain one hour of flying power. No amount of non-use allows the boots to be used for more than two hours at a time, however.
//Some winged boots are better than others. To determine the quality of a given pair, roll 1d4 and consult the table below:

The girdle causes the wearer to gain one point of Charisma with respect to halflings of the stout sort and with respect to all gnomes as well. Dwarves regard the wearer as if he has Charisma two points higher than before. The girdle enables the wearer to understand, speak, and read dwarvish language. The wearer also gains the racial benefits of dwarvenkind (i.e., +1 Constitution, saving throw bonuses based on total Constitution, 60-foot infravision, and detection/determination of approximate depth underground as described in the Player's Handbook). All bonuses and penalties apply only as long as the individual actually wears the girdle. Benefits such as additional languages and combat bonuses against giant-type-opponents never apply.

Thus, an 8th-level character without a magical weapon could not harm the imbiber of an invulnerability potion.
//The potion also improves Armor Class rating by 2 classes and gives a bonus of +2 to the individual on his saving throws versus all forms of attack. Its effects are realized only when the entire potion is consumed, and they last for 5d4 rounds. Only warriors can use this potion.

// Robe of the Archmagi: This normal-appearing garment can be white (45%—good alignment), gray (30%—neutral, but neither good nor evil, alignment), or black (25%—evil alignment). Its wearer gains the following powers:
//1. It serves as armor equal to AC 5.
//2. The robe confers a 5% magic resistance.
//3. It adds a +1 bonus to saving throw scores.
//4. The robe reduces the victim's magic resistance and saving throws by 20%/-4 when the wearer casts any of the following spells: charm monster, charm person, friends, hold monster, hold person, polymorph other, suggestion.
//The color of a robe of the archmagi is not determined until it is donned by a wizard. If a white robe is donned by an evil wizard, he suffers 11d4+7 points of damage and loses 18,000-51,000 experience points at the DM's discretion. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good aligned wizard. An evil or good wizard putting on a gray robe, or a neutral wizard donning either a white or black robe, incurs 6d4 points damage, 6,000-24,000 experience points loss, and the wearer will be moved toward the alignment of the robe by its enchantments (i.e., he will feel himself urged to change alignment to that of the robe, and he will have to make an effort to maintain his old alignment).

//Robe of Scintillating Colors: This garment appears quite normal, but a magical aura is detectable. Only a wearer with an Intelligence of 15 or higher and a Wisdom of 13 or more can cause a robe of scintillating colors to function. If Intelligence and Wisdom are sufficient, the wearer can cause the garment to become a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light.
//This effect sheds light in a 40-foot diameter sphere, and it has the power to hypnotize opponents, making them unable to attack the wearer. A full round passes before the colors begin "flowing'' on the robe. Each round after that, any opponent who fails a saving throw vs. spell (or magic resistance check, then save) will stand hypnotized and transfixed for 1d4+1 rounds. Even when this effect wears off, additional saves must be made in order to attack.
//Furthermore, every round of continuous scintillation of the robe makes the wearer 5% more difficult to hit with missile attacks or hand-held or body weaponry (hands, fists, claws, fangs, horns, etc.) until a maximum of 25% (-5) is attained—five continuous rounds of the dazzling play of hues.
//After the initial round of concealment, the wearer is able to cast spells or engage in all forms of activity that do not require movement of more than 10 feet from his starting position. In noncombat situations, the robe simply hypnotizes creatures failing their saving throws vs. spell for 1d4+1 turns.

The wearer will notice nothing unusual when the robe is donned, and it will actually convey some magical power at that time—protection +1, for example. However, as soon as the wearer is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment will be revealed: The wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of extreme discomfort from the movement and biting of these pests.

//Staff of Command: This device has three functions, only two of which will be effective if the wielder is a wizard; all three work when the staff is in a priest's hands. The three functions are:
//Human influence: This power duplicates that of the ring of the same name. Each suggestion or charge draws one charge from the staff.
//Mammal control/animal control:This power functions only as mammal control (as the ring of that name) when the staff is used by a wizard. In the hands of a priest it is a staff of animal control (as the potion of that name, all types of animals listed). Either use drains one charge per turn or fraction thereof.
//Plant control: This function duplicates that of the potion of the same name, but for each 10-square-foot ares of plants controlled for one turn or lass, one charge is used. A wizard cannot control plants at all.
//The staff can be recharged.

//Staff of the Woodlands: This sort of staff is always made from oak, ash, or yew, finely grained, beautifully carved, and bound with bronze. It is effective only in the hands of a druid. Each such staff has the following powers, with each expending one charge per use:
//• Wall of thorns
//• Animal friendship plus speak with animals
//• Animate tree*
//* This function duplicates the ability of a treant to cause a large tree to move at a movement rate of 3 and attack as if it were a largest-sized treant, and in all other respects becoming a virtual treant for eight rounds per charge expended. Note that one round is required for the tree to animate, and it will return to rooting on the eighth, so only six of the initial eight rounds are effectively available for the attack function.
//In addition to these powers, each staff of the woodlands has a magical weapon value. Those with a lesser value have extra magical powers that do not require charges and can be employed once per day: The +4 staff has no additional powers; the +3 staff also confers the power of pass without trace; the +2 staff confers the powers of pass without trace and barkskin; the +1 staff confers the powers of the +2 staff plus the power of the tree spell. To determine which sort of staff has been discovered, assign even chances for each of the four types.

//Scimitar of Speed: This is a magical weapon, usually of +2 bonus, that automatically grants its wielder the first attack in a melee round, even though some magical effect might have otherwise slowed his speed and reaction time. It also allows more than one strike in some rounds, increasing the wielder's figure for attacks per melee round by one place, so that if one attack is normal, then the improvement is to two attacks per round. This increase in attacks is cumulative with any other bonus attacks (such as those provided by a haste spell).
//The order of attacks in the round is determined normally after the wielder of the scimitar of speed has made his first attack to begin activity in the round. It is possible, for instance, that a wielder entitled to three attacks in the round will attack once before any other action takes place, and then (because of poor initiative rolls or other factors) take his remaining two attacks at the very end of the round.

//Gauntlets of Dexterity increase overall Dexterity by 4 points if the wearer's Dexterity is 6 or less, by 2 points if at 7-13, and by 1 point if Dexterity is 14 or higher. Furthermore, wearing these gloves enables a nonthief character to pick pockets (45% chance) or open locks (37% chance) as if he were a 4th-level thief. If worn by a thief, they increase these two abilities by 10%.

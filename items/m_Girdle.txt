//Girdle of Dwarvenkind: This belt lowers the wearers' Charisma score by 1 with respect to nondwarves and their ilk. The girdle causes the wearer to gain one point of Charisma with respect to halflings of the stout sort and with respect to all gnomes as well. Dwarves regard the wearer as if he has Charisma two points higher than before. The girdle enables the wearer to understand, speak, and read dwarvish language. The wearer also gains the racial benefits of dwarvenkind (i.e., +1 Constitution, saving throw bonuses based on total Constitution, 60-foot infravision, and detection/determination of approximate depth underground as described in the Player's Handbook). All bonuses and penalties apply only as long as the individual actually wears the girdle. Benefits such as additional languages and combat bonuses against giant-type-opponents never apply.

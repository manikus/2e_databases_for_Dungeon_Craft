//Rod of Smiting: This rod is a +3 magical weapon that inflicts 1d8+3 points of damage. Against golems, the rod causes 2d8+6 points of damage, and any score of 20 or better completely destroys the golem. Any hit upon a golem drains one charge.
//The rod causes normal damage (1d8+3) versus creatures of the Outer Planes. Any score of 20 or better draws off one charge and causes triple damage: (1d8+3) x3. The rod cannot be recharged.

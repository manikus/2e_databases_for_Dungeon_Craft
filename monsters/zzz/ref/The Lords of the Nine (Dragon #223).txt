The Lords of the Nine

It's no dark that the baatezu are cagey bash- ers. They've got secrets hidden that would astonish the powers, and they do their level best to keep their secrets dark; but occa- sionally they slip. When they do, their mysteries spill out across the multiverse. This article is based on the Baator book from the PLANESCAPE Campaign Set. It's highly recommended that one read that book before this text.
The Logs of Willgan the Dogged The years ain't been kind to me, but did that stop me? No. It didn't. And while those sods who called 'emselves scholars danced and laughed with the Sensates slipped away across the boundaries of death, I've held on, my studies just becoming all that much more important. And now they've paid off. I might not have been looking for the elusive sound of color or the mysteries behind the forms of the powers. I've never been that imaginative. Some'd call that a curse. Me, I call it a blessing. It means that I focus on the facts and don't let ill-formed fancies distract me from the truth. Do I seem bitter? I am. I've been mocked and reviled, my quest called emptiness, my heart left desolate from the bleakness of the truth I sought to uncover. But now it's done and I've snatched the dark right out from under the baatezu nose. Ha! I've got the dark on the Lords of the Nine, and I'll be cursed if anyone can stop me from making my life better from this point on!
The Lords of the Nine are the mysterious rulers of Baator, the Nine-Layered Pit, the Stinking Maw of the planes. Their origins are lost to the mists of time, seemingly
stretching back before even the powers remember. Their true capabilities have never been defined, at least until now. They are, in short, an enigma. What is their purpose? Do they simply act as war- dens for their plane, or do they play a more active role? Do they truly even exist? And how do they relate to the denizens of their plane, from the lowest baatezu to the most powerful of the gods? To understand the Lords, perhaps it's best to summarize exactly what it is they're said to be and do.
The Lords and What They Are Though many discount the Lords as the crazed imaginings of those who've wan- dered the bleak wastes of Baator, the truth is that the Lords have shaped the plane since time immemorial. They may seem to be nothing more than primal forces, incorporeal and unwanting, but that isn't so. They're all individuals, and they're all ferociously hungry for more power. It's just that their desires make them known over the millennia, as opposed to the petty length of a mortal lifetime. That's not to say that the Lords can't act quickly when they need to; they just prefer to make their plans on a much longer range. The Lords are each set over a single layer of Baator, their presence twisting and warping their layers to be more pre- cisely what they themselves embody. Thus it is that Avernus, the first layer, is a blast- ed and scarred wasteland, perfect for training the armies of baatezu in the end- less Blood War, while the fourth layer of Phlegethos is a fiery pit, burning all who travel its infernal depths. They are the defenders and protectors of each of these
layers, each Lord taking the qualities of the layer in an effort to keep its essential nature pure of the ravages of chaos. Who set them this task, none can say-but it's an assignment they fulfill to the best of their abilities. Every Lord has a name, though through- out time only the names of three have been commonly known. Just like other fiends, the names of the Lords of the Nine are names to conjure power with-the prime wizard who actually uses these names is in for a devil of a time, but that doesn't keep the attempted conjuring from being an inconvenience.
It wasn't without pain that I discovered their names. I've endured much for this moment, the setting of their names to paper and thus to immortality. Though these are not their true names, they are still names with power. The Lords are: Bel, Warlord of shattered Avernus; Dispater, Archduke of iron-hot Dis; Minauros, Viscount of the sunken Minauros; Fierana, the Fiery Lady of Phlegethos; Prince Levistus of watery Stygia; The Hag Countess Malagard of Malbolge; The Slug Archduke of Maladomini, Triel the Fallen; Baron Molikroth of ice-locked Cania; and the Dark Lord of shadowy Nessus.
Chant is that the Lords occasionally attempt to wrest away pieces of another Lord's layer. Prince Levistus, Lord of the Fifth, is said to be particularly greedy in this regard. It's thought that he's planning an assault on one of his compatriots-at least, that's the word in Stygia, his layer, and the amnizu baatezu there are busy recruiting berks they think would be good for the job.
Their Powers The Other Lords
The Lords are some of the most powerful bashers in the known cosmos. They con- trol whole layers of a plane, which is far more than most powers can claim. The Abyssal lords claim as much, but the chaot- ic politics of the Abyss ensure that the tanar'ri lords never rise far above their compatriots. The Lords of the Nine, on the other hand, are willing to set aside their differences to achieve a common goal; the Abyssal lords seem incapable of that.
In a sense, the Lords are their layers. They have the ability to shake the land around them, to make it erupt and heave up its contents. They can see all through their layer, piercing through nearly any veil thrown up for privacy-it's unclear as to whether they can see into a power's realm without the god's say-so. Of course, they're not omniscient. They aren't aware of every pebble's fall and every gust of wind-but if they wanted to be for a time, they could be. They'd just have to divert their attentions from other matters, that's all. Are they omnipotent on their home layer? It's unknown but the truth is that it'd be highly unlikely. They've got an incredible amount of power, yes, but that doesn't mean they can do everything. It's a well-known fact that they rarely coerce someone into doing something; the best- laid plots will make anyone of whatever station carry out his functions willingly, thinking whatever it is was his idea in the first place. Dispater especially loves to twist people into doing his bidding. Only in the most extreme cases will he ever use his immense might to warp a mind. They've got the powers of wind and rain, earth and fire at their disposal (though of course some are more likely to use one than the other). They've also got special- ties, each of them focusing on a particular destructive power. The Lord of Avernus uses explosions. Dispater uses emotion. Minauros favors disease. Fierana, natural- ly, punishes with flame, while Levistus car- ries the power of amnesia and its atten- dant miseries. The Hag Countess destroys by sheer force and crushing weight, while Triel fancies entropy and decay. Molikroth favors ice. . . and the ninth? None know, but it must be a fearsome power indeed, if no one will speak of it. Their Relationships
It's no dark that the Lords pass their orders to someone. They've got to have dealings with someone if they want anything accom- plished, right? So who do they deal with? The list is fairly small. They deal with each other, naturally. They bargain with the powers. They pass orders to the pit fiends and lesser baatezu. And occasionally, they'll make a pact with a mortal.
Their feelings about each other could be best described as resigned hatred. They despise each other, but they're rarely in a position where they can affect one another. As mentioned above, they occa- sionally attempt to poach some land from one layer or another, trying to increase their own holdings at the expense of their fellows, but this ploy rarely succeeds. When it does, it's not without conse- quence. Still, they find it an amusing game. Perhaps they're testing each other, or per- haps their role in this is to see what nature will emerge triumphant. Regardless of the truth, it's known that they use mortals as pawns in their endless games, steering them hither and yon in fruitless quests until the Lords grow bored of the charade. It has been said in legend that a mortal has actually managed to lure the Lords into outright fighting. How this was achieved, no one knows, but to match wits against the Lords of the Nine, you'd have to be barmy or brilliant... or both. The Lords are usually too busy to attend to every pressing matter. That's why they created the substrata of nobles below them. In fine feudal fashion, each has an entire staff and court who deals with the petty matters of the layer, leaving the Lord free to concentrate on truly important matters. The nobles are obviously of lesser ranks, though they might pretend to be of lofty status. All of them, however, are pit fiends of incredible power. Some are more powerful and long-lived than the Dark Eight themselves, while others are still young but show excellent cunning. The nobles plot and scheme on their own, working to further the ends of their masters and to benefit their own careers. It's said that when a pit fiend learns how the true power works and things are run, he can try to seize the mantle of the Lord for himself. It's happened several times. Naturally, these nobles are not above the use of mortals in their schemes. Some allow the mortals to play an important role in their plotting. And some actually encourage the mortals to develop their own schemes.
The Powers So what's the relationship of the Lords with the powers? Nobody really knows; probably strained at best, though it's unlikely that they're actively hostile to each other. Struggles among beings of this magnitude generally leave entire layers of planes devastated, and it's unlikely either the powers or the Lords would find that acceptable. Nevertheless, it's no secret that Set and Prince Levistus have nearly come to out- right war. The two have aims that aren't entirely compatible, and each works in subtle ways to bring down the other. Levistus has used his mortal agents to destroy temples dedicated to Set, while Set's minions wreak havoc on the amnizu
and the cities of Stygia. They've reached an impasse for now, but both would love a chance to tweak the nose of the other, and they'll handsomely reward anyone who can do it for them. Rumor has it that it was the enmity of one of the Lords that forced the orcish pantheon to flee to Acheron and points beyond. Now, that may or may not be true-but if it is, the Lords have got to be even mightier than previously believed. It's not unknown for the Lords and the powers to work together on occasion. They've got common enemies in the tanar'ri, bringers of chaos, not to mention various other powers. Why, a Lord might aid one of the powers on his or her own layer against the power from another. It's called the politics of expediency, and the Lords and the powers practice it whenever they can.
The Fiends This is the part that's most interesting to me. Why in all the heavens would someone as powerful as one of the Lords ever choose to have anything to do with the lowly fiend? Are the Lords watchers over the baatezu race, or do their duties run deeper than that? What is it that we're missing?
Oddly enough, the Lords tend to leave the fiends to their own devices. It's unknown if the Lords have any dealings with the Dark Eight, the nominal rulers of the baatezu. Still, one would think that the eternally raging Blood War would give the Lords pause for thought, since it's their land that's going by the wayside if the tanar'ri make it this far.
My thought on the matter is that the fiends are simply like the proxies of the Lords, that they're an even lesser tool than the noble caste. The Lords do care about the War; it's just so far down on their pri- orities that they've delegated it in its entire- ty to the baatezu.
The Lords certainly command vast armies of baatezu on their own-fiends who are outside the structure of the baatezu hierarchy imposed by the Dark Eight. Though the Lords' minions have to undergo the same selection and elevation tortures, they answer only to the nobles of the Lords, and to their Lord in particular. That doesn't keep the Dark Eight's baatezu enforcers from throwing these berks into the army when possible-it's said that the Lords' servants are insuffer- ably smug, and they're usually the ones in the front lines, unless they can find someone to take their place. All fiends eventually bow to the Lords of the Nine, if for no other reason than that the Lords could crush the life from the baatezu. But the fiends are rarely called upon to do such a thing, for the Lords have other servants and proxies to fulfill their wishes.
The Mortal Compact Once in a millenia, a mortal is powerful enough or canny enough to be able to sneak through the defenses of the Lords or perhaps the Lords allow it as part of some scheme they have. Regardless, the Lord conjured occasionally finds it amus- ing to manifest himself fully in the pres- ence of the mortal, gracing the poor sod with the complete glory of the Lord. Sometimes it's to burn the offender to cin- ders; more often it's to lead the mortal on a path of betrayal that'll drive him to insanity while increasing the Lord's power tremendously. This happens most commonly through priesthoods. The Lords gains power from mortal worshipers, just as a god would, though he cannot grant spells. Still, the devotion of mortals is a powerful thing, and it's something Lords covet. It's said that that's the reason the Lords even bother to trifle with mortals at all. The only problem is this: How do these cults retain worshipers if there's no evi- dence that they've got power? That's where the politics of expediency come in. Before establishing a priesthood on the Prime, the Lord usually has to perform a favor for one of the powers of Baator. In return (and usually in return for some of the power gained from the ceremonies), the power sends along some of his rituals to the mortal priest, creating a strange combination of beliefs, but one that's deadly nonetheless. These priesthoods have become more and more common of late. Their rites are obscene, their methods perverse. Are the Lords allowing more priesthoods? And if so, does that not mean they're trying to become powers in their own right? Whatever the cause, the cults of the Lords of the Nine are seducing more mor- tals with promises of power and immor- tality ever year, across the Prime and across the Outer Planes. It's only a matter of time before drastic measures must be taken to curb their worship.
The Lords Themselves
This was the hardest dark of all to come by. If the Lords resisted generalities about themselves for so long, how d'you think they'd feel about their personal secrets bein' spilled? Well, too bad, one way or another. They're going to have to face the music sometime, and it might as well be now. I've outlined their names, what I could glean of their histories, and any other information I thought might be useful.

The Warlord of Avernus
The original Lord of Avernus (not Tiamat, contrary to popular belief) found herself imprisoned and entrapped by her warlord, the pit fiend Bel, thousands of years ago. She's now struggling to break free, but her struggles become weaker and weaker as Bel siphons more of the Lord's power for himself. For all intents, Bel is the new Warlord of Avernus, and that suits the other Lords just fine-at least, it seems to; they've not lifted a finger to aid their ensnared sister. However, because of this, Avernus has become a little fiercer, more brutal than it was under the original Lord; and the Lord of the First now has little time to oversee the maintenance of the layer-for while he has the power, he does not have the time. He cannot back out of his responsi- bilities to the Dark Eight, though he could probably crush them if he so desired except that they remain in the fortress Malsheem in Nessus, and Bel's dominion extends only over the first layer. Bel has only recently discovered how to create an avatar. The avatar takes the form of a burly humanoid with a jutting chin and powerful arms. The avatar's skin is slightly tinged with red, and his brooding scowl and the promise of rage held barely in check dissuades many from offending the representative of the Lord of the First.

Special Att/Def: The sheer size and power of Bel's avatar is enough to make anyone of good alignment under the 10th level save vs. spells or suffer as if under the effects of a fear spell. Those of neutral or evil alignment under 10th level must save vs. spells or suffer from awe. If necessary, Bel can call forth 15 HD fire- balls from the air at will.
=========================================================================================================================
The Archduke of Dis Dispater is thought to be one of the oldest of the Lords of the Nine. He's certainly cunning enough that he'd want to give that impression anyway. He governs the second layer from his tower of lead and iron, able to see the tiniest details of the plane from the tower's height. His layer is a gray-green plane of heat and pain, perfectly reflecting the suave archduke. Dispater never loses his temper. Though anger burns within his chest, he prides himself on his restraint and smooth man- ner. Should he actually lose his temper, chances are he'll annihilate the witnesses rather than let them report his shame. Dispater's avatar appears as a 10' tall man with yellow skin, a pit fiend's horns, and a fluttering red cape.

Special Att/Def: In his tower, Dispater simply cannot be harmed. As it is his cen- ter of power, weapons pass through the archduke and spells melt harmlessly from his person. The statistics above are for the rest of the layer. Dispater's special defense is to make those attacking him relive their lowest moments. Whether they were being beaten in an alley behind a pub or falling from the heights of Mount Celestia, Dispater can summon the memory and make his enemies relive the entire miserable experience.
=========================================================================================================================
The Viscount of Minauros Minauros the Serpent dwells in the Sinking City, his bulk writhing and spas- ming through the fetid water of his layer. He's indirect and venomous, his schemes convoluted and twisted. He speaks in rid- dles, never coming straight to the point, even when giving orders. His cadre of fiends emulates this behavior, hoping to impress their Lord. Minauros seems to spend most of his time in the waters underneath his city, liv- ing an amphibious life amidst the foetor of his layer. He doesn't roam far from the Sinking City preferring to oversee his lands from a single location. The Viscount's avatar appears as a gar- gantuan snake with a humanoid torso where the head would be. His eyes are slitted and yellow, his tongue is forked, and he speaks in a sibilant whisper.

The Viscount's Avatar (fighter 14, thief 18)
Str 19 Dex 23 Con 21 Int 21 Wis 19 Cha 18 MV 12, Sw18 SZ G (30') MR 80% AC -5 HD 14 hp 160 #AT 5/2 THAC0 6 Dmg 1-8 + 14
Special Att/Def: Minauros can, on a suc- cessful attack roll of 15 or better, sink his fangs into one of his enemies. If Minauros drops his weapons and attacks with his powerful arms, he can try to pin his vic- tim; this requires two successful attack rolls of 8 or better. If he pins his victim in this fashion, he needs only an 8 or better to bite. A body thus bitten must save vs. poison or contract a wasting disease simi- lar to that of the mummy-except that the Viscount's disease cannot be healed, and it drains the life from its victims by the hour, rather than by the day.
=========================================================================================================================
The Fiery Lady of Phlegethos Fierana, Lady of Phlegethos, is rarely seen and her presence rarely felt. She prefers to lose herself in the boiling magma of her lands, letting the pit fiend Gazra govern; however, she's not foolish enough to let him have too much power, and she reminds him of her rightful position whenever she thinks he's planning on turning stag. Her temper is mercurial, her moods fickle. She's like the dancing flame, moving from one obsession to the next, burn- ing her way through eternity. However, she does so in a pattern that perhaps only she can see-anything less would be chaotic, and her job is to preserve order. Her avatar appears as a beautiful young woman with flaming red hair and a lithe figure. The berk who's fooled by her beauty deserves what he gets-being turned into a charred husk.

The Lady's Avatar (wizard 20)
Str 15 Dex 20 Con 19 Int 23 Wis 20 Cha 21 MV 18, F136 SZ M (6') MR 90% AC -3 HD 20 hp 140 #AT 2 THAC0 8 Dmg l-6 + 10 Special Att/Def: Fierana has absolute power over all flame in her layer. She can take any flame that's brought near her and turn it against anyone she desires. Oddly, she takes no damage from cold- or water-based attacks; they serve only to irritate her, and she'll burn anyone who's foolish enough to try them on her.
=========================================================================================================================
The Prince of Stygia Levistus is probably one of the least popu- lar of the Lords of the Nine, especially among his compatriots. He sets aside the rules they've laid down for themselves and is constantly attempting to aggrandize himself, usually at the expense of others. His cadre of amnizu ignores the hierarchy of the pit fiends, and they're always plan- ning mischief against the Dark Eight. Their concerted dislike of him is partially what has kept Levistus from overcoming the rest of the Lords. When they catch on to his schemes, they work together to destroy them; while they hate each
Levistus's avatar is a darkly handsome, brooding man. He prefers to dress in fancy clothes and adorn himself with fin- ery when he appears to mortals. However, he's usually too busy governing Stygia and hatching plans from his icy prison to bother himself with manifesting an avatar.

Str 19 Dex 24 Con 16 Int 23 Wis 22 Cha 21 MV 15 SZ M (6') MR 80% AC -4 HD 23 hp 155 #AT 2 THAC0 3 Dmg 1-8 + 10
Special Att/Def: With a suc- cessful attack, Levistus has the abil- ity to induce amnesia in his enemies as though he had
immersed them in the River Styx. If he's suc- cessful, he refrains from slaying his vic- tims, preferring instead to tantalize them with the tortu- ous hints of their previous existence.
=========================================================================================================================
The Hag Countess of Malbolge Malagard, the Hag Queen of the Crushing Lands, delights in surprise appearances. The cities of her layer are huge bronze citadels, each of which is under the command of a pit fiend. The citadels constantly resound from the huge boul- ders crashing into them, and the inhabitants need to be constantly vigilant of stresses in the bronze. If they're not, Malagard makes sure that the next inhabi- tants will be; more than one fortress has lost its inhabitants when she's come in with her great flaming sword to correct their mistakes. Malagard's avatar is not unreasonable, but she doesn't excuse foolishness. She appears as an old crippled hag, stooped from the weight of the years. She carries immense power under her withered exte- rior, teaching that it's best never to judge someone on the basis of appearance. She carries a sword that flames with her anger; it looks too heavy for her to wield, but in her hands it's as light as a feather. Anyone else who touches it takes an immediate 1d20 + 20 hp damage.

Special Att/Def: At will, the Hag Countess can bring a meteor swarm down on one particular enemy, or cause an avalanche to begin under his feet, or force a hail of rocks down upon his head from nowhere. She has absolute control over the physical aspects of her layer, and she'll not hesitate to use that control to destroy her enemies.

he Slug Archduke of Maladomini Triel the Fallen was once an archon, or so the chant goes, who was expelled from the lofty heights of Mount Celestia for excessive vanity and the contemplation of eternal perfection taken to extremes. His fellows cast him from the celestial slopes, and his form changed as he fell into the Stinking Maw of Baator. Now he presides over the rotting cities of Maladomini, always searching for the perfect configu- ration to his city. He's oblivious to the decay of the old cities, always wanting to improve on the new ones. His avatar is a grossly deformed slug-crea- ture, with vaguely humanoid features and forelimbs that are more like prehensile tails than actual limbs. Still, a mortal who gazes on the avatar can catch glimpses of the beauty that Triel once possessed before he fell.

Special Att/Def: Triel prefers to age his victims as if he had hit them with a staff of withering. If he makes a successful hit with one of his atrophied forelimbs, his victim gains no save and loses the use of his limb.

The Baron of Cania Molikroth is devious and cruel. No surprise there. What is surprising is the extent to which he takes it. As ruler over frigid Cania, he's got the power of ice and cold, and he knows how to use those tools to such a degree that he can make a proxy cry out for mercy. He delights in torture, rarely leaving the citadel Mephistar, preferring to
last few millenia, he's been on his guard against a move by Prince Levistus, and he's grown ever more leery over the years. No one passes into this layer without the Baron's knowledge. The Baron's avatar is a grossly huge man, beyond foppish in his finery. His clothes are always the height of style in Sigil, and are usually made of ridiculously expensive materials; but even the finest fashions appear foolish on him.

There's no spell known that can resist the frigid batterings of the Baron's will. Frostbite sets in in one round, causing 1d6 hp damage a round. If he's still fighting an enemy after 5 rounds, his opponent must begin to save vs. spells or suffer a cumula- tive -1 penalty per round the enemy fails the save as the cold slows reflexes and induces torpor.

The Dark Lord of Nessus I've not been able to find any information on this blood. He (or she, to be totally fair) is so well hidden that it'll take years more of digging through dusty references and painstaking interviews with fiends who should know better. I've come this far though, and I won't be cheated. I can stand to search-for a few more years, I think. What's the worst that could happen to me?

Note: Not long before publication, Willgan the Dogged suffered from what can only be termed a personal implosion. Drops of blood were found where he stood, but no other trace remains of his eventual disposi- tion. We have taken the liberty of publish- ing this posthumously. Several fiends have commented on it as a delightful piece of speculative fiction.

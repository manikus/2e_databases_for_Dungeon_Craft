Long, gangly limbs covered by purulent gray flesh; an over-sized, horned head with an obscene mouth comprising nothing but teeth and tongue; distant, glazed yellow eyes dripping fluid far more vile than tears — all these things are a baernaloth, yet it is more. The essence of the creature is callous detatchment, never seeing the suffering and pain that it ceaselessly creates; an unending, unsatiable need for misery and affliction; a monster that mechanically, methodically hurts, harms, foils, impairs, and hinders all other creatures.

In many ways, the baernaloths are the outcasts among the ranks of the yugoloths. They rarely associate with other yugoloths, and are always found on the Gray Waste, never on Gehenna, where so many of the others have migrated. Some people wonder it perhaps the baernaloths are not true yugoloths at all, but rather some older, even more primal creatures. If this is true, baernaloth and yugoloth alike are propagating some sort of intentional deception (not that such a thing is at all inconceivable.

As “greater” yugoloths, baernaloths may be the weakest of their type when it comes to sheer might. Nevertheless, they are afforded a great deal of respect from their kind (when the rare occasion occurs and they actually come upon other yugoloths) — far more than their physical or magical power would warrant, for reasons unknown.

Combat: In hand-to-hand combat, the baernaloth rakes with its savage claws (1d8 points of damage per strike) and rears at its foes with its huge mouth (2d6 points of damage). Baernaloths never use weapons or equipment of any kind, even magical items. Accompanying these physical attacks, however, are two strange powers relating to the baernaloth’s goal of causing pain and spreading misery. Three times per day, the creature can cause wounds created by his claws and mouth to worsen, tearing open painfully. With this attack, the baernaloth can wreak the same amount of damage that he has previously inflicted upon a foe in one round sometime during the last 24 hours. For example, if a baernalolh uses his claws and bite to inflict 13 points of damage upon a foe and then casts him into a dungeon, the baernaloth can return anytime within the next day and instantly indict 13 additional points of damage upon that particular foe. There is no saving throw against this ability (although magic resistance still applies), but the target must be within 10 yards, and within sight. This ability can be used in addition to the baernaloth’s normal attacks during a single round.

Conversely, a baernaloth can instantly heal any or all damage that it inflicts. This can be done as often as it likes. with a range of 10 yards. It uses this ability to keep captives — and even foes in battle — alive so that the fiend can continue to inflict pain. Obviously, the baernaloth is intelligent enough to keep from using this ability in a way whlch puts itself in jeopard (by healing its opponents too much, for example).

In addition to the powers inherent to all yugoloths (alter self, cause disease, charm person, improved phantasmal force, produce flame, and teleport without error), baernaloths can use the following spell-like powers once per round, at will: darkness 15-foot radius, detect lie, detect magic, emotion, fear, suggestion, cloudkill (3 times/day), true seeing (3 times/day), symbol (1 time/day), and demand (1 time/day). As all yugoloths, baernaloths are immune to the effects of acid, magical and normal fire, iron weapons, and poison. They suffer only half normal damage from cold-based attacks. Magical weapons are required to harm a baernaloth.

Habitat/Society: Usually found alone, baernaloths sometimes have nightmares or even night hags as companions. Baernaloths like to lair in twisted, forbidding towers in areas desolate even by the standards of the Gray Waste. Although the arcanaloths are the scholars and record-keepers of the yugoloth ranks, baernaloths are said to be in the possession of mysterious and varied secrets. They certainly seem to know more about fiends of all types, and Lower-planar creatures in general, than any other singular source. More than anything else, though, baernaloths see their place in the scheme of things as bringers of misery and pain. They specialize in torture, not as a means of interrogation, but as agony for agony’s sake.

Emotionlessly, coldly, they bring anguish upon others. Oftentimes they find means other than simple physical pain to accomplish this end. Baernaloths seem to relish folling well-laid plans, spreading vicious lies, and revealing sinister secrets in order to cause dismay. All the while, these creatures of evil stare at their victims with a chillingly disturbing detachment. Baernaloths take no apparent pleasure in their work, yet certainly show no regret.

Ecology: Rellian Whi’ys was a sage and scholar whose theories on the planes are still studied by today’s learned scholars. In her treatises on the Lower Planes, she contemplated the fiends that inhabited them as a whole. The tanar’ri she saw as the destroyers, tearing apart things both literally and morally. The baatezu, she said, were the subjugators, again both in a literal sense and morally as well. These she saw as the ends of the dark spectrum of evil. (The organization among the tanar’ri ranks and the destructive nature of many baatezu are, of course, convincing arguments that her theories are far too simplistic).

The yugoloths, Rellian thought, were the true force of pure evil on the Lower Planes. She saw them as a representation of suffering (at worst) and cold, unfeeling detachment (at best). The baernaloths, perhaps more than the rest of their brethren, epitomize Rellian’s views of the multiverse. They see the actions taken by the other yugoloths, making moves to control things around them, and scoff at their plans and schemes.

Strangely, the Book of Keeping makes no mention whatsoever of the baernaloth.

The Demented

Apparently, madness is not an affliction to which baernaloths are immune. It is unusual, but not unknown, to see a baernaloth commanding a brigade of mixed fiends in a Blood War skirmish. Likewise, at least one baernaloth serves as advisor and confidant to the most prominent ultroloth masters. These baernaloths are referred to as the Demented. Their madness is not a raving, hysterical insanity, but an insidiousm, mind-altering malady.

The Demented, individually or in a group, decide that they are going to attempt to control the events around them, subtly subjugating the creatures of the Lower Planes while plotting the destruction of all things. Somehow, they have decided to embrace both of the ends of the ethical spectrum, seeking rigid order and utter devastation at the same time. Although they are the exceptions (to what are already the exceptions among yugoloths), these baernaloths are actually the ones most likely to be encountered by player characters, since most baernaloths are reclusive and generally inactive.

Canoloths’re specialzed yugoloths who serve as scouts, skirmishers, and trackers for the yugoloth mercanary companies. They’re not as common as the mezzoloths or dergholoths that make up the bulk of these units, but a couple of canoloths can greatly increase the effectiveness of a yugoloth company by providing the piscoloth or nycaloth commanders with excelent intelligence and reconnaissance reports.

Canoloths resemble great semi-instectile mastiffs, their hulking forms plated in chitinous armor. Their bodies’ve got a distinctly bulldoglike shape to them, with massive jaws and short, squat, forelegs. Their mouths are made up of both a horizontal set ot teeth and a vertical set of teeth just behind, and a vile barbed tongue often lolls out of the creature’s mouth. The canoloth’s nostrils’re gaping wounds in the front of its skull, and it has no eyes — it relies on its uncanny senses of smell and hearing to find its quarry.

Canoloths can communicate with semi-intelligent or higher creatures by means of an innate power of telepathy.

Combat: Canoloths’re never surprised. Their smell and hearing give them the equivalent of normal vision to a range of 240 feet, and darkness or normal invisibility don’t hinder their perception in the slightest. However, tenches such as a stinking cloud, cloudkill, or a pot of burning naphtha can “blind” a canoloth when accompanied by very loud noises. (Routine yelling or screaming won’t cut it.) Canoloths won’t be affected by any spell that uses a visual effect, such as glitterdust, phantasmal force, hypnotic pattern, and the like.

Canoloths attack with two slashes of their stubby foreclaws for 1d6 points of damage each, and a bite of their horryfying jaws that inflict 6-15 (3d4+3) points of damage. The canoloth’s powerful mandibles destroy its victim’s armor on a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, but magical armor gains a saving throw versus crushing blow to avoid this effect.

In place of its melee attacks, a canoloth can instead use its barbed tongue to entangle its prey. The creature’s tongue can strike targets up to 20 feet away and works much like the tongue of a frog or chameleon. The strike inflicts 1d6 points of damage if the cnnoloth hits, and the victim must survive a saving throw versus paralyzation or be helplessly entangled on the wicked barbs and sticky slime of the canoloth’s tongue.

The canoloth can draw its victim back to its mouth and automatically hit with its bite attack in the next round; the victim has to make a bend bars/lift gates roll to resist being drawn to the yugoloth. If the victim’s friends try to pull him free, they’ll need a combined total of 34 Strength points to disentangle him from the tongue. Optionally, the tongue can be attackes with Type S weapons; it’s AC 4 and has 15 hit points.

Canoloths suffer no damage from add, magical or normal fire, iron weapons, or poison and only half damage from poisonous gas. They suffer double damage from cold-based attacks. Like all yugoloths, they can use the spell-like powers of alter self, cause disease, charm person, improved phantasmal force, produce flame, and teleport without error. In addition, canoloths can also use the following abilities one at a time at will: cloudkill (1/day), darkness 15’ radius, fear, passwall, and shout (1/day). Once per day the canoloths can gate 1 to 4 additional canoloths or 1 to 3 mezzoloths with a 50% chance of success.

Canoloths can be struck only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment.

Habitat/Society: Although canoloths’re a,ong the weakest yugoloths, they’re considered valuable by the leaders of the yugoloth armies. It’s not uncommon for greater yugoloths to have several canoloths at their beck and call; canoloths make excellent guards, assassins or retrievers. Their lack of intelligence makes canoloths the most loyal of the race, and they’ll follow the orders of their masters to the death — a rare trait among the lesser yugoloths.

Canoloths are well aware of their favored status and use it to bully and pester mezzoloths or hydroloths. When they’re not employed with a mercenary company, canoloths spend their time bounding through the foul wastes of the Lower Planes in search of lesser creatures to torment and slay.

It’s not unusual to see canoloths saddled and used as great, fearsome mounts by arcanaloths or ultroloths.

Ecology: It’s thought that canoloths’re created from particularly courageous mezzoloths, but there’s little to substantiate this. The creatures’re common on the Gray Waste and Gehenna. Some spells of binding and entrapment make use of a piece of the tongue of a canolnth; the organ’ll bring about 1,000 gp in the right market.

Gacholoths are the infiltrators and terrorists of the Blood War. They use their abilities to cause havoc and spread panic behind enemy lines. They also might spend months, years, even centuries, serving in the army of a temporary master with unquestioned loyalty, while secretly waiting for the best moment to reveal their true allegiance and begin a reign of slaughter and terror.

Gacholoths have a roughly humanoid appearance. Their bodies are an ebony black, and they have four long and powerful legs, each tipped with three sharp claws to aid in climbing. Their well-muscled torsos have two arms, each ending in a hand with four fingers that are tipped with savage, retractable claws. Gacholoth skulls are bony, their ears are triangular and flare back; a thick shock of dark hair flows back from a receding hairline. Sharp fangs thrust forward prominently, while the sunken eyes are cold and inhuman. Something about their skull structure suggests sahuagin.

Gacholoths communicate using telepathy.

Combat: Gacholoths can see 90 feet in normal darkness. Their four powerful legs enable them to move with blinding speed on any surface, climbing walls and ceilings without hindrance. They can fight from any angle without disorientation, even hanging upside down.

As a consequence of their speed and maneuverability, gacholoths have a +5 bonus to their initiative in the first round of combat (initiative in subsequent rounds is determined normally). Gacholoths often strike swiftly and savagely before their opponents can react, then immediately withdraw from combat until another opening presents itself.

Their sudden attack has another effect. Anyone attacked by a gacholoth for the first time (whether hit or not) must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or go into shock. This shock is a fear attack that induces irrational terror; the victim drops all hand-held items and is rooted to the spot for 1d6 rounds. Regardless of whether or not the victim makes his saving throw, no subsequent attack by the same gacholoth will cause this shock effect.

Gacholoths do not carry weapons, magical or otherwise, preferring to rely on the speed and ferocity of their natural weapons. The gacholoth either strikes with both claws (70% of the time) or bites (30% of the time). A bite inflicts 1d10 points of damage, while the claws inflict 2d6 points of damage. The claws also secrete a stinging, acidic venom. Any creature hit by a claw attack must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage.

As with other yugoloths, the gacholoth has the following spell-like abilities: alter self, improved phantasmal force, animate dead, cause disease, charm person, produce flame, and gate (50% chance for one gacholoth, 1/day). In addition, gacholoths have the following powers, at 5th-level spell use, usable once per round, at will: darkness 15’ radius, feather fall, magic missile, and mirror image.

Gacholoths are unaffected by acid, poison, and charm spells. They take half damage from gas attacks, including poisons gases, but double damage from cold-based attacks.

Habitat/Society: The gacholoths’ fondness for deceit and terror make them favored troops in yugoloth conflicts, and many have risen to minor positions of power as a result.

Gacholoths have a particular interest in the workings of the Prime Material plane and will take any opportunity to enter that plane and indulge in a reign of bloodletting. They often use their shock ability to play with their victims, paralyzing them and making a leisurely job of it.

Gacholoths consider themselves to be the great betrayers and terrorists of the Outer Planes and will not allow others of similar skill to outdo them. For example, they have an intense hatred of succubi and erinyes, taking pleasure in torturing to death any of these they capture. Gacholoths often clash with cambions, and nearly always become their bitter rivals.

Ecology: The origin of the gacholoths is unknown. All of them appear to be male; no distinctly female versions have ever been sighted. The faint resemblance to sahuagin suggests some long-lost connection between these creatures and the “devil men of the deep”, but hard evidence has yet to be discovered.

Yugoloth, Lesser, MarraenolothThe marraenoloths are a special type of yugoloth. The thin, gray, pale-eyed humanoids are easily identified by their skeletal faces, somber hooded robes, and eyes that glow red when they are angry. They are a cold species, mercenary at heart, like all yugoloths. They are telepathic and, in addition to speaking all languages, maintain mental contact with others of their race at all times.

Combat: Marraenoloths have all the standard powers of tho yugoloths, but also use the following powers at will: alter self, animate dead, cause disease, charm person, improved phantasmal force, produce flame, and teleport without error. In addition, marraenoloths can gate in 1d6 hydroloths (75% chance), should the need arise.

These yugololhs are not great warriors, attacking only with tiheir bony fangs. When angered, a marraenoloth’s eyes glow fiery red, and anyone confronted by this horrifying gaze must successfully save vs. spell or be affected as by a fear spell. The marraenoloth will then summon hydroloths to fight for it.

Marraenoloths have 80% magic resistance to 1st-level spells. This resistance decreases by 5% for each higher level of spell. (Thus, a marraenoloth’s resistance to 7th-level spells is only 50%.) They are immune to acid, fire, and poison, and they suffer only half damage from gases. Their greatest weakness is cold-based attacks, which inflict double damage upon them.

Habitat/Society: Marraenoloths are unique among the yugoloths in that they havy an established task: They are boatmen who pilot small skiffs on the black waters of the River Styx. Unlike many other fiends, the marraenoloths can pass from plane to plane without arousing suspicion in the minds of others. They are ferrymen and ferrymen only. Other fiends would love to subvert the marraenoloths to spy on their Blood War enemies, but these creatures are only concerned with their passengers.

Marraenoloths have an innate understanding of the twists and bends of the River Styx’s channels, so they never get lost (unless it’s convenient to do so). These creatures also can pilot their crafts through the Astral Plane and to the boundary of the Prime Material Plane. They can actually enter the Prime Material, too, but they must leave their skiffs behind. A marraenoloth without a vessel is lost and useless, so they are naturally reluctant to venture far from their crafts. Occasionally they are summoned or sent to the Prime, anyway, to transport some being to or from the Lower Planes (using a special plane shift ability that work for this task only).

Marraenoloths carry passengers but never cargo, always demanding immediate payment for their servixes. (Greater fiends may ignore this, forcing the marraenoloth to serve them.) The may demand a magical item, a bag of 10 platinum coins, or two gems of 50 gp value (or more). If not paid, the marraenoloth will seek to prevent the would-be passenger from entering its boat, and it will teleport itself and its craft away at the first opportunity.

Even if a marraenoloth is paid (as opposed to being sent by a higher evil force), there is still a 15% chance that the creature will betray the passenger, either by delivering him to the incorrect destination or plane (85% chance) or by leading the summoner into an ambush (15% chance). This chance of betrayal can be reduced by making additional contributions to the marraenoloth’s hoard (-5% per additional payment listed above).

Since all marraenoloths are aware of each other, all know of any person who cheats or harms anyone of their kind. They won’t come to each other’s aid (that would indicate concern for their fellows), but the identity of the transgressor is noted, and future services from any of these yugoloths will require greater payments and incur a significantly higher risk of treachery. The cheater can return to the good graces of the boatmen only by making a suitable sacrifice to all their kind. The nature of this tribute is left to the DM, but a typical one would be the surrender of rare gems or several unique magical items, presented with due ceeremony and contrition.

Ecology: There are among the most neutral of the evil yugoloths, existing to collect their fares and nothing else. They stay clear of the politics of the Blood War. Because their skills are valuable to tanar’ri and baatezu alike, the other fiends tolerate this neutrality. As much as some infernal lord might like to subjugate them, it’s understood they would no longer function properly if that happened.

As a marraenoloth without its sailing duties is fairly worthless, even as a lowly foot soldier in the Blood War, no one has attempted to take control of them. However, they may unwittingly play pawns in the subtle plottings of some baatezu or tanar’ri.
